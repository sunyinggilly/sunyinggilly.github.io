== About me
I am currently a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~heqing Prof. Qing He] and co-supervised by [http://fuzhenzhuang.github.io Prof. Fuzhen Zhuang]. 

In 2017, I received my B.S. degree in soft engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology ([https://bit.edu.cn/ BIT]). During university, I was an International College Programming Contest (ICPC) participant and became a finalist in the fourth year.

From 2018 till now, I study as a research intern in Baidu Talent Intelligence Center (TIC) under the supervision of [http://zhuhengshu.com/ Dr. Hengshu Zhu]. During this period of time, I'm also fortunate to be advised by [http://datamining.rutgers.edu/ Prof. Hui Xiong].

My general research interest includes data mining and machine learning, focusing on developing effective and explainable machine learning methods to reason from real-world talent, job, and labour market-related data. Here is my [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A9L70nUAAAAJ&hl=en Google Scholar].
